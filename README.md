# Airbnb Clone Project

## About the Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. This project provides an immersive experience in full-stack development, with a focus on backend systems, database design, API development, application security, and collaborative team workflows. By working through this project, learners will gain practical experience in building scalable web applications and understanding complex software architectures.


## 1. Team Roles

- **Backend Developer:** Designs and implements the server-side logic, APIs, and ensures the applicationâ€™s business logic is robust and scalable.
- **Database Administrator:** Plans, creates, maintains, and secures the database, ensuring data integrity and optimal performance.
- **Frontend Developer:** (If applicable) Implements user interfaces and connects frontend components to backend services.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and monitors infrastructure.
- **Project Manager:** Oversees project progress, coordinates team efforts, and ensures deadlines and quality standards are met.
- **QA Engineer:** Designs and executes tests to ensure the application meets requirements and is free of critical bugs.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Django:** Web framework used to build robust and scalable RESTful APIs for the backend.
- **MySQL:** Relational database system for storing application data such as users, properties, and bookings.
- **GraphQL:** API query language for flexible and efficient data retrieval between client and server.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool to ensure consistent development and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD platform for automating testing, integration, and deployment workflows.
- **(Optional) React/Vue.js:** Modern JavaScript frameworks for building interactive user interfaces (if frontend is included).

## 3. Database Design

**Key Entities and Fields:**

- **Users:** `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
- **Properties:** `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`
- **Bookings:** `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`
- **Reviews:** `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `date`
- **Payments:** `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`, `timestamp`

**Entity Relationships:**

- A **user** can own multiple **properties**.
- A **property** can have multiple **bookings** and **reviews**.
- A **booking** belongs to one **user** and one **property**.
- A **review** is submitted by a **user** for a **property**.
- A **payment** is linked to a **booking**.

## 4. Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:** Handles user registration, authentication, profile management, and role assignment, ensuring secure and personalized access.
- **Property Management:** Enables users to list, update, and manage properties, including descriptions, pricing, and availability.
- **Booking System:** Allows users to search for properties, make reservations, and manage their bookings with real-time availability checks.
- **Review System:** Lets users leave and view reviews on properties, enhancing transparency and trust within the platform.
- **Payment Processing:** Integrates secure payment gateways, allowing users to make online payments for their bookings and ensuring accurate transaction records.
- **Admin Dashboard:** (If applicable) Provides administrative controls over users, listings, and platform analytics.

## 5. API Security

- **Authentication:** Use of secure authentication mechanisms (such as JWT, OAuth) to verify user identities.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive endpoints (e.g., only property owners can edit their listings).
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single user or IP.
- **Input Validation:** Ensure all API inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Data Encryption:** Protect sensitive data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.

Security is crucial for protecting user data, securing payment processes, and maintaining the overall integrity of the platform.

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD pipelines automate the build, test, and deployment processes, enabling rapid and reliable delivery of updates.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically runs tests and builds the application on each commit to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automates deployment to staging or production environments after successful CI checks.
- **Tools:** GitHub Actions for pipeline automation, Docker for containerized deployments, and optional cloud services for hosting.

## 7. Manual Review

All changes and features implemented undergo manual code review and testing to ensure adherence to best practices, code quality, and project requirements.
